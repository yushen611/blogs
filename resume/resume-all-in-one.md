### Blockchain Transaction Risk Monitoring Based on LLM

* **title**
  - **Period:** 2023.08-2023.12
  - **Location:** NTU CSLAB

- **content**
  - Summary: To precisely track on-chain risks, we employ the advanced LLM (LLaMA2) language model for text embedding and use a Graph-Transformer for deep semantic analysis. This method both categorizes and scores transaction risks.
  - Fine-Tuning LLM: By fine-tuning the LLM language model, we enhanced its ability to semantically map transaction text.
  - Optimize prompts with GOT: Using the latest Prompt Optimization Technology (GOT), we significantly improved the quality of text fed into the large model.
  - Training Adoptor for semantic mapping of transactions: By combining GNN and Transformers, we enhanced the model's understanding of transactions through precise semantic mapping.

### AI Text-to-Video Generator

* **title**
  - **Period:** 2022.03-2022.12
  - **Location:** Virtual Reality AI-Lab In HFUT

- **content**
  - Summary: This optimized TransCGAN algorithm quickly generates custom action videos from text and excels in performance and industrial potential.
  - New DL Model: The published TransCGAN model successfully integrates CGAN and Transformer, specifically designed for high-quality human action generation. The model has achieved industry-leading standards in both speed and quality, demonstrating excellent potential for industrial applications.
  - Outcome: EI Paper 《TransCGan-based human motion generator》(First Author)

### Web SQL Injection ML-Detector

* **title**
  - **Period:** 2023.03-2023.06
  - **Location:** AI-Lab In HFUT

- **content**
  - The world's best Machine Learning SQL injection detector: Applied word2vec model with positional encoding for query string vectorization, followed by one-dimensional convolution to reduce noise in sentence vectors. Trained a random forest model, achieving 97% accuracy. Outperformed 'libinjection' (78% accuracy) and TF-IDF with SVD (90% accuracy).
  - Faster computational speed: Compared to deep learning (DL), machine learning (ML) can be computed using just a CPU, resulting in faster processing speeds. More practical in industrial applications.
