`Gin` `GPRC `  `Consul ` `Redis ` `dcoker ` `CI/CD ` `Kubernetes` `Prometheus`

- **Overview**: Developed an online video streaming platform with gin and grpc, utilizing microservices and distributed architecture for high QPS and stability. Implemented logging, monitoring, and CI/CD to significantly improve performance and efficiency.
- **System Metrics Monitoring and Alerting**: Monitored server status using Prometheus, Grafana, and Altermanager. After Post-Load Testing through Jmeter, performance bottleneck analysis is employed with ELK log recording and PPROF flame graphs for performance bottleneck analysis.
- **High Concurrency and High Performance**: Achieved an interface QPS of over 1500 by using Redis, establishing DB Index and Read-write separation, Server Scale Out with Kubernetes, and a pagination query to optimize the slow-query video list interface.
- **CI/CD**: Compressing the entire process from Code Changes to Deployment into a 2-minute timeline by implementing CI/CD using Docker and Github Action.

`LLM` `LLaMA2` `Fine-tuning`
- **Summary**: Fine-tuned LLaMA2 to create a large model for EVM transaction risk detection.
- **Large Language Model Fine-tuning**: By fine-tuning a large language model, we enhanced its semantic mapping capabilities for transaction texts, enabling accurate transaction risk classification with an accuracy of 80%.
- **Prompt Optimization**: Improved the model's risk identification accuracy further through techniques like Gradient-based Optimization of Text (GOT) and other prompt optimization methods.

**2024.01-2024.02**
:::

`EVM ` ` ERC-7583` `inscription ` `Indexer `

* **Summary**: Implemented an EVM inscription system and an open-source indexer by implementing the ERC-7583 protocol.
* **lowest gas fee**: By storing NFT / FT in transaction events, the cost for each minting is brought close to the minimum transaction fees
* **fast performance**: Improved the indexer's performance with caching and incremental reading optimizations, boosting the response time from 13 seconds to just 1 second
